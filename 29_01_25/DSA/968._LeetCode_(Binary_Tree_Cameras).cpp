Approach

The problem requires placing the minimum number of cameras in a binary tree to monitor all nodes. 
Each camera placed at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Key Concepts Used:
Tree Traversal: The solution uses a post-order traversal (left, right, root) to handle subtrees before making decisions at the current node.
Greedy Approach: Cameras are placed only where absolutely necessary to cover uncovered nodes or subtrees efficiently.
State Management: Each node can have one of three states:
0: Not covered
1: Covered but no camera
2: Covered and has a camera

solve(TreeNode* root, int &camera)
Base Case:
If the current node is nullptr, it is considered covered (return 1).

Recursive Calls:
Recursively check the left and right child nodes

Decision Making:

If either child is not covered (left == 0 || right == 0), place a camera at the current node (camera++).
Return 2 to indicate that this node has a camera.
If either child has a camera (left == 2 || right == 2), the current node is already covered.
Return 1.
If both children are covered but have no cameras (left == 1 && right == 1), the current node is uncovered.
Return 0.

minCameraCover(TreeNode* root)
Initializes camera to count the total number of cameras.
Calls solve(root, camera).
If the root node itself is uncovered (rootstate == 0), place one more camera.
Returns the total number of cameras.

Time Complexity: O(N) â€” Each node is visited once.
